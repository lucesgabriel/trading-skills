## Quick Start

### Via Claude Code (Recommended)
```
scan EURUSD for patterns
```

Claude will automatically:
1. Fetch live price data from MetaTrader 5
2. Analyze candlestick patterns across M15, H1, H4, D1 timeframes
3. Calculate confluence scores and probabilities
4. Generate a beautiful HTML report in `reports/`
5. Open the report automatically

### Via Python
```bash
# Quick analysis
python examples/quick_start.py EURUSD

# Advanced multi-symbol scan
python examples/advanced_example.py

# Batch scanning
python tools/batch_scanner.py EURUSD GBPUSD XAUUSD --open
```

### MCP Configuration
Enable required MCP permissions in `.claude/settings.local.json`:
```json
{
  "enableAllProjectMcpServers": true,
  "enabledMcpjsonServers": ["metatrader"],
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "mcp__metatrader__get_symbol_price",
      "mcp__metatrader__get_candles_latest"
    ]
  }
}
```

Then restart Claude Code to load the updated skills.

## CLI Tools
- `python tools/standalone_scanner.py EURUSD --timeframes M15,H1,H4,D1`
  - Optional `--sample-data path/to/EURUSD.json` to run offline fixtures
- `python tools/batch_scanner.py EURUSD GBPUSD XAUUSD --open`
  - Optional `--sample-dir data/samples` for per-symbol JSON inputs

Both commands write reports to `reports/` and reuse the same core modules as the skill.
