# Risk Management Calculator

Calculate optimal position sizes, manage risk exposure, and ensure sustainable trading.

## Usage

Quick calculation (will ask for details):
```
/risk EURUSD
```

With trade parameters:
```
/risk EURUSD entry:1.0850 stop:1.0820
```

Portfolio risk assessment:
```
/risk --portfolio
```

## What It Does

Use the risk-management skill to:

1. **Get Account Information** - Retrieve current account balance, equity, margin level
2. **Calculate Position Size** - Based on:
   - Account balance
   - Risk percentage (default: 1-2%)
   - Stop loss distance (in pips)
   - Symbol pip value
3. **Risk/Reward Analysis** - Evaluate trade viability
4. **Portfolio Assessment** - Monitor overall exposure and correlation risk
5. **Position Sizing Recommendations** - Conservative, standard, aggressive options

## Core Risk Principles

**1% Rule:**
- Maximum 1% of account balance per trade (conservative)
- Maximum 2% for standard risk tolerance
- Never exceed 5% total portfolio exposure

**Position Sizing Formula:**
```
Lot Size = (Account Balance √ó Risk %) / (Stop Loss Pips √ó Pip Value)
```

**Risk:Reward Targets:**
- Minimum: 1:1.5
- Target: 1:2 or 1:3
- Conservative: 1:3+

## Output Format

**Account Summary:**
- Balance and equity
- Available margin
- Current exposure (%)

**Position Size Calculation:**
- Recommended lot size (conservative/standard/aggressive)
- Risk amount in account currency
- Potential profit at TP levels
- Risk:Reward ratio

**Risk Assessment:**
- Overall portfolio risk (%)
- Correlation with open positions
- Margin requirements
- Risk warnings if excessive

## Example

```
/risk EURUSD entry:1.0850 stop:1.0820
```

## Position Sizing Tips

1. **Never risk more than 1-2% per trade**
2. **Keep total portfolio exposure under 20%**
3. **Account for correlation** - Don't trade multiple correlated pairs simultaneously
4. **Scale in gradually** - Split position across multiple entries
5. **Adjust for volatility** - Wider stops in volatile markets = smaller position
