## Pattern Psychology

Understanding why patterns work:

**Bullish Engulfing:**
- Bears pushed down, bulls completely reversed
- Shows strong shift in sentiment
- Previous sellers now trapped

**Hammer:**
- Price rejected lower levels
- Buyers stepped in aggressively
- Lower prices not accepted

**Morning Star:**
- Downtrend weakening (small middle candle)
- Bulls take control (large bullish candle)
- Clear sentiment shift over 3 periods

**Doji:**
- Perfect balance of forces
- Market at decision point
- Often precedes large move

## Advanced Pattern Recognition

### Multi-Candle Analysis
Look beyond single patterns:
- Pattern clusters (multiple patterns nearby)
- Pattern sequences (one pattern following another)
- Pattern divergences (price vs momentum)

### Timeframe Harmony
Best signals when patterns align:
- M15 pattern confirmed by H1 pattern
- H1 pattern in direction of H4 trend
- H4 pattern with D1 trend support

### Volume Profile
Enhance pattern reliability:
- High volume on pattern = stronger signal
- Low volume on counter-move = pattern holding
- Volume spike on breakout = confirmation
